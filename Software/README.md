Before creating the application project, remember to create a custom domain under psu_cortexa53 processor with a linux OS IN THE PLATFORM OBJECT YOU MADE!

When creating the application project, select psu_cortexa53 SMP for the target and use the linux domain created in the previous step.

After creating the application project, copy the C file into the src directory, change the build settings if needed to add the library path for cross compiling!
